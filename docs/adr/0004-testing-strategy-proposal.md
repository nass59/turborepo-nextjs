# 0004: Choose Testing Strategy for Components and Applications

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context and Problem Statement

The project needs a comprehensive testing strategy that covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for both the design system components and Next.js applications.

## Decision Drivers

* Component library testing requirements
* Next.js application testing needs
* AI-assisted test generation capabilities
* Performance and speed of test execution
* Developer experience and ease of writing tests
* CI/CD integration requirements

## Considered Options

### Testing Frameworks
* **Vitest** - Fast, modern test runner with native ESM support
* **Jest** - Traditional, mature testing framework
* **Playwright** - End-to-end testing framework
* **Cypress** - Popular E2E testing tool

### Component Testing
* **React Testing Library** - Component testing with user-centric approach
* **Storybook Test Runner** - Visual regression testing
* **Chromatic** - Visual testing service

### Integration Testing
* **Supertest** - API testing
* **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** - API mocking
* **Next.js testing utilities** - Framework-specific testing

## Decision Outcome

**Status: Pending Discussion**

Proposed combination:
- **Vitest** for unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Playwright** for E2E testing
- **Storybook Test Runner** for visual regression testing

### Reasons for Proposal

* Vitest provides excellent performance and TypeScript support
* React Testing Library aligns with user-centric testing philosophy
* Playwright offers modern, reliable E2E testing
* Storybook integration leverages existing component documentation

### Positive Consequences (Expected)

* Fast test execution with Vitest
* Comprehensive test coverage across all layers
* Good TypeScript integration
* AI-friendly test patterns
* Visual regression testing capabilities

### Negative Consequences (Expected)

* Multiple tools to learn and maintain
* Potential complexity in CI/CD setup
* Additional dependencies and configuration

## Implementation

### Code Changes Required
- [ ] Install and configure Vitest
- [ ] Set up React Testing Library
- [ ] Configure Playwright for E2E tests
- [ ] Set up Storybook test runner
