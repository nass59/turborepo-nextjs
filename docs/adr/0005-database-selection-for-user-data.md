# 0005: Database Selection for User Data

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-08-25
**Deciders:** [List of people involved]

## Context and Problem Statement

The application needs a robust database solution to store and manage user data, including user profiles, preferences, authentication information, and application-specific data. The solution must support the Next.js architecture, scale with user growth, and integrate well with our TypeScript-first development approach.

## Decision Drivers

* Scalability requirements for user growth
* Integration with Next.js and Vercel deployment
* TypeScript support and type safety
* Developer experience and ease of use
* Cost considerations for different scale levels
* Data consistency and ACID compliance requirements
* Real-time capabilities for collaborative features
* Backup and disaster recovery options
* Security and compliance requirements

## Considered Options

* **MongoDB** - Document database with flexible schema
* **PostgreSQL** - Relational database with JSON support
* **PlanetScale** - Serverless MySQL platform
* **Supabase** - Open source Firebase alternative
* **Firebase Firestore** - Google's NoSQL document database
* **Prisma + PostgreSQL** - Type-safe database toolkit
* **Drizzle + PostgreSQL** - Lightweight TypeScript ORM

## Decision Outcome

**Status: Proposed**

Proposed option: "MongoDB with Mongoose", because it provides excellent flexibility for evolving user data schemas, integrates well with our JavaScript/TypeScript stack, and offers good scalability options.

### Positive Consequences

* Flexible schema allows for rapid feature development
* Excellent integration with Node.js/TypeScript ecosystem
* Strong community and extensive documentation
* Good performance for read-heavy workloads
* Easy horizontal scaling with replica sets
* JSON-like documents align with JavaScript objects
* Rich query capabilities and aggregation framework

### Negative Consequences

* Less ACID compliance compared to relational databases
* Potential for data inconsistency if not carefully managed
* Learning curve for developers familiar with SQL
* More complex for relationships between entities
* May require more careful schema design planning

## Implementation

### Code Changes Required
- [ ] Install MongoDB driver and Mongoose ODM
- [ ] Set up database connection configuration
- [ ] Create user data models and schemas
- [ ] Implement data access layer with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Set up database migrations and seeding
- [ ] Configure connection pooling and optimization
- [ ] Add database error handling and logging

### Migration Strategy
- [ ] Start with user authentication data
- [ ] Gradually migrate from any existing storage
- [ ] Implement proper backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Plan for data migration tools if needed

## AI Context

### Complexity Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium
- **Business Impact**: High
- **Maintenance Burden**: Medium

### Related Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Domain-driven design for data modeling
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event sourcing for audit trails

### Future Considerations
- Potential migration to PostgreSQL for complex relationships
- Implementation of caching layer (Redis)
- Data analytics and reporting requirements
- Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Integration with third-party services
- Performance optimization and indexing strategies

## Notes

This decision focuses on user data storage requirements. The choice should be reevaluated as the application grows and requirements become more complex. Consider starting with MongoDB for rapid development and potentially adding PostgreSQL for complex relational data later.
