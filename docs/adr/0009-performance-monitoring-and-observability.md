# 0009: Performance Monitoring and Observability

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context and Problem Statement

The application needs comprehensive performance monitoring and observability to ensure optimal user experience, identify performance bottlenecks, and proactively address issues before they impact users. The solution should cover both client-side and server-side performance metrics.

## Decision Drivers

* User experience optimization and Core Web Vitals
* Server-side performance monitoring and APM
* Real-time alerting for critical performance issues
* Developer debugging and performance optimization tools
* Integration with existing deployment and hosting infrastructure
* Cost-effectiveness for different scale levels
* Data retention and analysis capabilities
* Compliance with privacy regulations

## Considered Options

### Performance Monitoring
* **Vercel Analytics** - Integrated with Vercel deployment platform
* **Google Analytics 4 + Web Vitals** - Free Google solution
* **New Relic** - Comprehensive APM platform
* **DataDog** - Full-stack monitoring and analytics
* **Sentry Performance** - Error monitoring with performance tracking

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)
* **Vercel Speed Insights** - Built-in Vercel solution
* **Google PageSpeed Insights API** - Core Web Vitals monitoring
* **Lighthouse CI** - Automated performance testing
* **WebPageTest** - Detailed performance analysis

### Server Monitoring
* **Vercel Runtime Logs** - Built-in server monitoring
* **Winston + Custom Dashboard** - Custom logging solution
* **Pino + Elastic Stack** - High-performance logging
* **Cloud provider monitoring** - AWS CloudWatch, etc.

## Decision Outcome

**Status: Proposed**

Proposed option: "Vercel Analytics + Sentry Performance + Custom Monitoring Dashboard", because it provides comprehensive coverage while leveraging the existing Vercel infrastructure and maintaining cost efficiency.

### Positive Consequences

* Seamless integration with existing Vercel deployment
* Comprehensive performance metrics and error tracking
* Real-time alerting and monitoring capabilities
* Good developer experience with unified dashboards
* Cost-effective solution for startup to medium scale
* Strong privacy compliance and data protection
* Easy setup and configuration

### Negative Consequences

* Vendor lock-in with Vercel ecosystem
* Limited customization compared to enterprise solutions
* Potential need for additional tools as scale increases
* Learning curve for team members new to these platforms
