# 0008: State Management Strategy

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-08-25
**Deciders:** [List of people involved]

## Context and Problem Statement

The application needs a state management strategy that works effectively with Next.js App Router, React Server Components, and client-side interactivity. The solution should provide good developer experience, type safety, and performance while avoiding over-engineering for simple state needs.

## Decision Drivers

* Integration with Next.js App Router and React Server Components
* Client-side state management for interactive components
* Server state synchronization and caching
* TypeScript support and type safety
* Developer experience and learning curve
* Performance considerations (bundle size, runtime)
* Testing and debugging capabilities
* Scalability for complex application state

## Considered Options

### Client State Management
* **React Built-in State (useState, useReducer)** - React native solutions
* **Zustand** - Lightweight state management library
* **Redux Toolkit** - Traditional Redux with modern DX
* **Jotai** - Atomic state management
* **Valtio** - Proxy-based state management

### Server State Management
* **React Query (TanStack Query)** - Server state management
* **SWR** - Data fetching and caching library
* **Apollo Client** - GraphQL client with caching
* **Native fetch with Next.js caching** - Built-in solutions

## Decision Outcome

**Status: Proposed**

Proposed option: "Hybrid approach with Zustand for client state and TanStack Query for server state", because it provides excellent TypeScript support, minimal complexity, and works well with React Server Components.

### Positive Consequences

* Minimal learning curve and setup complexity
* Excellent TypeScript integration
* Good performance with small bundle size
* Clear separation between client and server state
* Strong ecosystem and community support
* Easy testing and debugging
* Flexible and unopinionated architecture

### Negative Consequences

* Need to learn and maintain two different libraries
* Potential for inconsistent state management patterns
* Less powerful than Redux for very complex state scenarios
* May require additional boilerplate for complex state logic

## Implementation

### Code Changes Required
- [ ] Install Zustand for client state management
- [ ] Install TanStack Query for server state
- [ ] Create store setup and configuration
- [ ] Implement state management patterns and utilities
- [ ] Set up provider components for Next.js App Router
- [ ] Create custom hooks for common state operations
- [ ] Add TypeScript types for state interfaces
- [ ] Implement state persistence where needed

### Migration Strategy
- [ ] Start with local component state (useState)
- [ ] Identify shared client state needs for Zustand
- [ ] Implement server state management with TanStack Query
- [ ] Gradually refactor existing state management
- [ ] Add state management documentation and guidelines
- [ ] Set up development tools and debugging

## AI Context

### Complexity Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: Low to Medium
- **Business Impact**: Medium
- **Maintenance Burden**: Low

### Related Patterns
- Flux/Redux pattern for predictable state updates
- Observer pattern for state subscriptions
- Command pattern for state actions
- Repository pattern for data access
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Future Considerations
- State persistence and hydration strategies
- Performance optimization for large state trees
- Integration with form libraries (React Hook Form)
- Real-time state synchronization (WebSockets)
- State management for micro-frontends
- Advanced caching and invalidation strategies

## Notes

This decision prioritizes simplicity and developer experience while providing room for growth. The hybrid approach allows for different strategies for different types of state, following the principle of using the right tool for the job. Regular evaluation should ensure the chosen tools continue to meet the application's evolving needs.
