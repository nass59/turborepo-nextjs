# 0001: Use TypeScript with Strict Mode

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context and Problem Statement

The project needs strong type safety to improve code quality, reduce runtime errors, and enhance developer experience with better IDE support and AI assistance.

## Decision Drivers

* Type safety and error prevention
* Better IDE and AI tooling support
* Code maintainability and refactoring safety
* Team productivity and onboarding
* Integration with modern React and Next.js patterns

## Considered Options

* TypeScript with strict mode
* TypeScript with loose configuration
* JavaScript with JSDoc types
* Plain JavaScript

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "TypeScript with strict mode", because it provides the strongest type safety guarantees and best tooling support for AI-assisted development.

### Positive Consequences

* Catch type errors at compile time
* Excellent IDE autocomplete and refactoring
* Better AI code generation and understanding
* Self-documenting code through types
* Easier onboarding for new team members

### Negative Consequences

* Slightly more verbose code
* Learning curve for team members new to TypeScript
* Additional build step complexity

## Implementation

### Code Changes Required
- [x] Configure TypeScript with strict mode in base config
- [x] Set up proper tsconfig.json inheritance
- [x] Configure IDE settings for optimal TypeScript experience
- [ ] Add type definitions for all existing code

### Migration Strategy
- [x] Enable strict mode gradually by file/module
- [x] Use `any` type sparingly and only where necessary
- [x] Implement proper type guards for runtime type checking

## AI Context

### Complexity Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium
- **Business Impact**: High
- **Maintenance Burden**: Low

### Related Patterns
- Strict typing patterns
- Type-driven development
- Interface segregation principle

### Future Considerations
- Consider moving to even stricter settings as team expertise grows
- Evaluate new TypeScript features for enhanced type safety
- Potential integration with runtime type validation libraries
