# 0010: API Design Standards

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-08-25
**Deciders:** [List of people involved]

## Context and Problem Statement

The application needs consistent API design standards for both internal and external APIs. This includes REST endpoints, data structures, error handling, authentication patterns, and documentation standards. The solution should provide good developer experience while maintaining scalability and security.

## Decision Drivers

* Consistency across all API endpoints
* Type safety with TypeScript integration
* Good developer experience for API consumers
* Scalability and performance considerations
* Security and authentication patterns
* Documentation and discoverability
* Integration with existing Next.js architecture
* Future-proofing for API evolution

## Considered Options

### API Architecture
* **Next.js API Routes** - Built-in Next.js API solution
* **tRPC** - Type-safe APIs with full-stack TypeScript
* **GraphQL with Apollo** - Query language and runtime
* **REST with OpenAPI** - Traditional REST with documentation
* **Fastify + Next.js** - Separate API server

### Type Safety & Validation
* **Zod** - Runtime validation and TypeScript inference
* **Joi** - Object schema validation
* **Yup** - Schema validation library
* **TypeBox** - JSON Schema based validation

### Documentation
* **OpenAPI/Swagger** - Industry standard API documentation
* **Postman Collections** - Interactive API documentation
* **Custom documentation** - Hand-written API docs

## Decision Outcome

**Status: Proposed**

Proposed option: "Next.js API Routes + Zod validation + OpenAPI documentation", because it provides excellent integration with the existing stack while maintaining type safety and comprehensive documentation.

### Positive Consequences

* Seamless integration with Next.js App Router
* Full TypeScript type safety from client to server
* Runtime validation with compile-time type inference
* Industry-standard API documentation
* Good performance with server-side rendering
* Easy testing and debugging
* Familiar patterns for the development team

### Negative Consequences

* Potential scaling limitations compared to dedicated API servers
* Less flexible than GraphQL for complex queries
* Additional tooling setup for OpenAPI generation
* Possible vendor lock-in with Next.js ecosystem

## Implementation

### Code Changes Required
- [ ] Create API route structure and conventions
- [ ] Set up Zod schemas for request/response validation
- [ ] Implement OpenAPI documentation generation
- [ ] Create API middleware for common functionality
- [ ] Set up API testing framework and utilities
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging standards
- [ ] Create API client utilities and hooks
- [ ] Add rate limiting and security measures

### Migration Strategy
- [ ] Start with core user management APIs
- [ ] Establish validation and error handling patterns
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI documentation automatically
- [ ] Create reusable API utilities and middleware
- [ ] Implement comprehensive API testing
- [ ] Document API design guidelines and best practices

- DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern
- Request/Response pattern
- Middleware pattern for cross-cutting concerns
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience

### Future Considerations
- API versioning strategies
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Caching strategies for API responses
- API analytics and monitoring
- Integration with third-party services
- Potential migration to microservices
