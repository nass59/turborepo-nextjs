# 0007: Error Handling Strategy

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-08-25
**Deciders:** [List of people involved]

## Context and Problem Statement

The application needs a comprehensive error handling strategy that provides good user experience, helpful debugging information for developers, and proper error monitoring and alerting. The strategy must work across Next.js Server Components, Client Components, API routes, and external service integrations.

## Decision Drivers

* User experience during error conditions
* Developer debugging and troubleshooting efficiency
* Error monitoring and alerting requirements
* Consistent error handling across the application
* Type safety for error handling in TypeScript
* Performance impact of error handling mechanisms
* Security considerations (not exposing sensitive information)
* Integration with existing logging and monitoring tools

## Considered Options

* **React Error Boundaries + Custom Error Components** - React-native approach
* **Next.js Error Pages + Global Error Handler** - Framework-specific solution
* **Sentry + Custom Error Handling** - Third-party error monitoring
* **Custom Error Handling System** - Built from scratch
* **Combination Approach** - Multiple strategies for different scenarios

## Decision Outcome

**Status: Proposed**

Proposed option: "Combination Approach with Error Boundaries, Next.js Error Pages, and Sentry", because it provides comprehensive coverage for all error scenarios while maintaining good user experience and developer productivity.

### Positive Consequences

* Comprehensive error coverage across all application layers
* Good user experience with graceful error handling
* Excellent debugging capabilities with Sentry integration
* Type-safe error handling with TypeScript
* Performance monitoring and alerting capabilities
* Consistent error presentation across the application
* Easy integration with existing development workflow

### Negative Consequences

* Additional complexity in error handling logic
* Multiple tools and concepts to learn and maintain
* Potential for inconsistent error handling patterns
* Additional cost for Sentry service
* Possible performance overhead from error monitoring

## Implementation

### Code Changes Required
- [ ] Set up React Error Boundaries for component errors
- [ ] Create custom error pages (404, 500, etc.)
- [ ] Implement global error handler for unhandled errors
- [ ] Set up Sentry for error monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create error utility functions and custom error types
- [ ] Implement API error handling middleware
- [ ] Add error logging and reporting mechanisms
- [ ] Create error handling documentation and guidelines

### Migration Strategy
- [ ] Start with basic Error Boundaries and error pages
- [ ] Implement Sentry integration for production monitoring
- [ ] Add comprehensive error types and utilities
- [ ] Gradually improve error messages and user experience
- [ ] Set up alerting and monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Train team on error handling best practices

## AI Context

### Complexity Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium
- **Business Impact**: High
- **Maintenance Burden**: Medium

### Related Patterns
- Error Boundary pattern for React components
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Retry pattern with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation pattern
- Fail-fast pattern for invalid inputs

### Future Considerations
- Advanced error recovery mechanisms
- User-specific error reporting and feedback
- Integration with customer support systems
- A/B testing for error message effectiveness
- Performance impact monitoring and optimization
- Compliance with privacy regulations for error data

## Notes

This strategy prioritizes user experience while providing comprehensive error monitoring and debugging capabilities. The implementation should be done incrementally, starting with critical error scenarios and expanding coverage over time. Regular review of error patterns and user feedback should guide improvements to the error handling strategy.
