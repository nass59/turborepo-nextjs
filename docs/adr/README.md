# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the turborepo-nextjs project. ADRs capture important architectural and technical decisions, providing context and reasoning for future reference.

## ADR Statuses

- **âœ… Accepted** - Decision has been made and implemented
- **ðŸ”„ Proposed** - Decision is proposed and under discussion
- **ðŸš« Deprecated** - Decision is no longer relevant
- **ðŸ”„ Superseded** - Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## How to Use ADRs

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/000X-your-decision-title.md
   ```

2. **Fill in the details:**
   - Context and problem statement
   - Decision drivers
   - Considered options
   - Decision outcome
   - Implementation details

3. **Update this index** with the new ADR

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** - Initial ADR creation for discussion
2. **Accepted** - Decision approved and ready for implementation
3. **Implemented** - Decision has been implemented
4. **Deprecated** - Decision is no longer relevant
5. **Superseded** - Replaced by a newer decision

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- **Architecture**: System design, patterns, frameworks
- **Technology Choices**: Languages, libraries, tools
- **Development Practices**: Coding standards, workflows
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, monitoring, security
- **API Design**: Interface design, data formats
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies, trade-offs

### ADR Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Focus on one decision per ADR
2. **Explain Why**: Include reasoning and trade-offs
3. **Include Context**: Describe the situation that led to the decision
4. **Consider Alternatives**: List other options considered
5. **Think About AI**: Include AI context for better understanding
6. **Keep Updated**: Update status as decisions evolve

## Future ADRs to Consider

### Immediate Needs (Created âœ…)

## Benefits for AI Development

ADRs help AI tools by:

1. **Context Understanding**: Provides reasoning behind code structure
2. **Decision History**: Shows evolution of architectural thinking
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Establishes consistent decision-making patterns
4. **Risk Assessment**: Documents known trade-offs and limitations
5. **Future Planning**: Guides similar future decisions
