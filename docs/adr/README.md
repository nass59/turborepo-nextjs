# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the turborepo-nextjs project. ADRs capture important architectural and technical decisions, providing context and reasoning for future reference.

## ADR Statuses

- **✅ Accepted** - Decision has been made and implemented
- **🔄 Proposed** - Decision is proposed and under discussion
- **🚫 Deprecated** - Decision is no longer relevant
- **🔄 Superseded** - Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## How to Use ADRs

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/000X-your-decision-title.md
   ```

2. **Fill in the details:**
   - Context and problem statement
   - Decision drivers
   - Considered options
   - Decision outcome
   - Implementation details

3. **Update this index** with the new ADR

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** - Initial ADR creation for discussion
2. **Accepted** - Decision approved and ready for implementation
3. **Implemented** - Decision has been implemented
4. **Deprecated** - Decision is no longer relevant
5. **Superseded** - Replaced by a newer decision

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- **Architecture**: System design, patterns, frameworks
- **Technology Choices**: Languages, libraries, tools
- **Development Practices**: Coding standards, workflows
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, monitoring, security
- **API Design**: Interface design, data formats
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies, trade-offs

### ADR Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Focus on one decision per ADR
2. **Explain Why**: Include reasoning and trade-offs
3. **Include Context**: Describe the situation that led to the decision
4. **Consider Alternatives**: List other options considered
5. **Think About AI**: Include AI context for better understanding
6. **Keep Updated**: Update status as decisions evolve

## Future ADRs to Consider

### Immediate Needs (Created ✅)
- [x] **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL with Prisma on NeonDB → [ADR-0005](0005-database-selection-for-user-data.md)
- [x] **Authentication System**: Detailed Clerk integration decisions → [ADR-0006](0006-authentication-flow-implementation.md)
- [x] **State Management**: Zustand vs other solutions for complex state → [ADR-0008](0008-state-management-strategy.md)
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling strategy → [ADR-0007](0007-error-handling-strategy.md)
- [x] **Performance Monitoring**: APM and analytics tools → [ADR-0009](0009-performance-monitoring-and-observability.md)

### Medium-term Decisions
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n)**: Language support strategy
- [ ] **CDN Strategy**: Asset delivery optimization
- [ ] **SEO Optimization**: Technical SEO implementation
- [x] **API Design Standards**: REST vs GraphQL vs tRPC → [ADR-0010](0010-api-design-standards.md)
- [ ] **Form Management**: React Hook Form integration patterns
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Zod schemas and validation strategies

### Long-term Considerations
- [ ] **Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling and microservices
- [ ] **Security Framework**: Comprehensive security approach
- [ ] **Mobile Strategy**: Mobile app or PWA considerations
- [ ] **Data Analytics**: User analytics and business intelligence
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Deployment and testing automation
- [ ] **Documentation Strategy**: API docs, user guides, and knowledge base

## Benefits for AI Development

ADRs help AI tools by:

1. **Context Understanding**: Provides reasoning behind code structure
2. **Decision History**: Shows evolution of architectural thinking
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Establishes consistent decision-making patterns
4. **Risk Assessment**: Documents known trade-offs and limitations
5. **Future Planning**: Guides similar future decisions
