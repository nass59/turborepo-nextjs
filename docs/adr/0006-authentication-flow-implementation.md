# 0006: Authentication Flow Implementation

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-08-25
**Deciders:** [List of people involved]

## Context and Problem Statement

The application requires a secure, scalable authentication system that supports multiple sign-in methods, user management, and integrates seamlessly with Next.js App Router and React Server Components. The solution should provide good developer experience while maintaining security best practices.

## Decision Drivers

* Security and compliance requirements
* Multiple authentication providers (email, OAuth, social logins)
* Integration with Next.js App Router and RSC
* User management capabilities (profiles, roles, permissions)
* Developer experience and ease of implementation
* Scalability for growing user base
* Session management and security
* TypeScript support and type safety
* Cost considerations and pricing model

## Considered Options

* **Clerk** - Complete authentication platform with React integration
* **NextAuth.js** - Open source authentication library for Next.js
* **Supabase Auth** - Authentication as part of Supabase platform
* **Auth0** - Enterprise authentication platform
* **Firebase Authentication** - Google's authentication service
* **AWS Cognito** - Amazon's authentication and user management
* **Custom JWT implementation** - Build authentication from scratch

## Decision Outcome

**Status: Proposed**

Proposed option: "Clerk", because it provides excellent Next.js integration, comprehensive user management features, and significantly reduces development complexity while maintaining security best practices.

### Positive Consequences

* Excellent Next.js and React Server Components integration
* Built-in user management dashboard and APIs
* Multiple authentication methods out of the box
* Strong TypeScript support and documentation
* Handles complex security concerns automatically
* Good developer experience with clear APIs
* Scalable infrastructure managed by experts
* Regular security updates and compliance features

### Negative Consequences

* Vendor lock-in and dependency on external service
* Additional monthly costs as user base grows
* Less customization compared to building custom solution
* Potential limitations for very specific requirements
* Learning curve for Clerk-specific patterns

## Implementation

### Code Changes Required
- [ ] Install and configure Clerk SDK for Next.js
- [ ] Set up Clerk provider and middleware
- [ ] Implement authentication routes and components
- [ ] Create user profile management interfaces
- [ ] Set up role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Configure environment variables and API keys
- [ ] Implement sign-in/sign-up flows
- [ ] Add authentication guards for protected routes

### Migration Strategy
- [ ] Start with basic email/password authentication
- [ ] Add social login providers incrementally
- [ ] Implement user profile and preferences
- [ ] Add role-based permissions system
- [ ] Set up webhook handlers for user events
- [ ] Configure development, staging, and production environments

## AI Context

### Complexity Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: Low (with Clerk) / High (custom implementation)
- **Business Impact**: High
- **Maintenance Burden**: Low (with Clerk) / High (custom)

### Related Patterns
- Authentication middleware pattern
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT token management
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
- Session management patterns

### Future Considerations
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation
- Single sign-on (SSO) for enterprise customers
- Integration with external identity providers
- Audit logging and compliance requirements
- Performance optimization for authentication flows
- Mobile app authentication integration

## Notes

This decision prioritizes developer productivity and security over cost optimization. Clerk provides a comprehensive solution that allows the team to focus on core application features rather than authentication infrastructure. The decision can be revisited if custom requirements or cost constraints become significant factors.
