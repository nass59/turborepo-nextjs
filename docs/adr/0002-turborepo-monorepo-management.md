# 0002: Use Turborepo for Monorepo Management

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context and Problem Statement

The project needs to manage multiple applications (web, storybook) and packages (design-system, typescript-config) efficiently with shared dependencies, consistent tooling, and optimized builds.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for efficient build caching and parallelization
* Shared dependency management across packages
* Consistent tooling and configuration
* Developer experience optimization
* CI/CD performance requirements

## Considered Options

* Turborepo - Modern monorepo build system
* Nx - Enterprise-grade monorepo toolkit
* Lerna - Traditional monorepo management
* Rush - Microsoft's monorepo manager
* Manual workspace management with pnpm

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Turborepo", because it provides excellent build performance with minimal configuration overhead and integrates well with our pnpm + Next.js stack.

### Positive Consequences

* Blazing fast builds with intelligent caching
* Simple configuration and setup
* Excellent integration with Vercel deployment
* Built-in task orchestration and parallelization
* Great developer experience with hot reloading

### Negative Consequences

* Newer tool with smaller ecosystem compared to Nx
* Limited advanced features compared to enterprise solutions
* Dependency on Vercel ecosystem

## Implementation

### Code Changes Required
- [x] Configure turbo.json with task definitions
- [x] Set up package.json scripts for turbo commands
- [x] Configure caching strategies for different task types
- [x] Set up development and build pipelines

### Migration Strategy
- [x] Gradual migration from individual package scripts
- [x] Maintained backwards compatibility with existing workflows
- [x] No breaking changes to development experience

## AI Context

### Complexity Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: Low
- **Business Impact**: High
- **Maintenance Burden**: Low

### Related Patterns
- Monorepo architecture pattern
- Build optimization pattern
- Shared configuration pattern

### Future Considerations
- Remote caching for team collaboration
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Potential migration to Nx if enterprise features needed
